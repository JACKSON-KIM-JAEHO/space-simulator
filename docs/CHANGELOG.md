# CHANGELOG.md

## Version 1.2.14 (25-01-01)
### Changes
- **Scenario Configuration**
  - Added `scenario.environment` in `config.yaml` to specify the scenario module path (improved flexibility for switching scenarios by editing `config.yaml`). Example:
    ```yaml
    scenario:
      environment: scenarios.simple.env
    ```
  - Updated `main.py` to load the environment dynamically using:
    ```python
    env_module = importlib.import_module(config.get('scenario').get('environment'))
    ```


## Version 1.2.13 (24-12-31)
### New Features
- **Scenario Management (`main.py`, `env.py`)**
  - Refactored the simulation structure by separating `main.py` and scenario-specific logic into `env.py`. 
    - This allows for better management of multiple scenarios by keeping scenario-specific implementations modular.
    - The existing functionality of `main.py` has been retained in `env.py` with minimal modifications to maintain compatibility.
### Known bugs and limitations
  - **Status Variables**: `env.py` should encapsulate its status variables in a dictionary format and provide a unified `observe()` method for external access.
  - **Decision-Making Status Display**: The `decision_making_module.draw_decision_making_status()` method in `env.py` for rendering is currently confusing and has been commented out for simplification.
  - **Result Saving**: Consider whether functions like `record_gif`, `save_timewise`, and `save_agentwise` should reside in `main.py` or `env.py`. Current implementation retains them in `env.py`.
  - **Configuration Saving**: The `save_config_yaml()` function depends on `config.args`, which is not passed to `env.py`. This has been commented out and will require handling in `main.py`.

### Changes
- **Minor Revision**
  - `agent.py`: remove an unnecessary global variable (i.e., `font`) outside `Agent` class. 

## Version 1.2.12 (24-08-20)
### Changes
- **Simulation**
  - Removed `local_broadcast()` and replaced it with `local_message_receive()`.
  - Updated agent movement in the simulation to be based on per second rather than per loop.
  - Added a `speed_up_factor` option in `config.yaml` to allow simulations to run faster than real-time.
  - Introduced `max_simulation_time` to terminate the simulation after a specified duration.

- **Winning Bids Canceling to CBBA (`cbba.py`)**
  - Modified the `winning_bid_cancel` option based on simulation time; and renamed its parameter to `acceptable_empty_bundle_duration` 


- **Changed how to use `mc_runner.py`**
  - Updated usage for `mc_runner.py`: Now, to run multiple configurations simultaneously, list the desired configuration file names under `cases` and set `num_runs` in `mc_runner.yaml`. Then, execute the following command:  
  ```bash
  python mc_runner.py --config=mc_runner.yaml
  ```

- **Changed how to use `mc_analyzer.py`**
  - Updated usage for `mc_analyzer.py`: 
    ```bash
    python mc_analyzer.py --config=mc_analyzer.yaml
    ```

- **Refactored `my_decision_making_plugin.py`**
  - Refactored based on usecases of GRAPE and CBBA

- **Decision-Making Plugins Restructured**
  - Moved each decision-making plugin into its own subfolder, each accompanied by a README.md for detailed descriptions. 


## Version 1.2.11 (24-08-05)
### Changes
- **Winning Bids Canceling to CBBA (`cbba.py`)**
  - Removed the `enforced_collaboration` option as it had no effect.
  - Added the `winning_bid_cancel` option: If an agent is aware of local tasks but fails to form a bundle (repeatedly over the simulator's sampling frequency), it will cancel the winning bid.
  - Bug fixes: Ensured that if bundle convergence is not achieved, the robot movement is definitely stopped (`self.agent.reset_movement()`).

- **Support for Multiple Configuration Files in Monte Carlo Runner (`mc_runner.py`)**
  - Modified to read `mc_runner.yaml` and perform Monte Carlo Tests for the corresponding cases all at once. Previously, only one `config.yaml` could be used for Monte Carlo Tests. Now, multiple configurations can be set and executed at once.

## Version 1.2.10 (24-07-31)
### Changes
- **Behavior Tree (`behavior_tree.py`)**
  - Added `LocalSensingNode` and moved local sensing functionalities (e.g., `get_tasks_nearby()`) from `main.py` and `DecisionMakingNode` to this new node.


## Version 1.2.9 (24-07-30)
### Changes
- **Refactoring Monte Carlo Analyzer (`mc_analyzer.py`) and and Util (`utils.py`)**
  - Added functionality to aggregate data by agent and generate boxplots of the inequality indices (Gini coefficient) for `task_amount_done` and `distance_moved`.
  - Refactored `utils.py`: `ResultSaver` now saves episode data to CSV files and `mc_analyzer.py` handles the necessary analysis.
  - Updated `main.py` to append the suffix `timewise` to time series data and `agentwise` to data by agent.
  - Added `output_folder` to `mc_comparison.yaml` to specify the folder for saving Monte Carlo Analysis results.

- **CBBA (`cbba.py`)**
  - Reduced `deepcopy` for faster operation. 
  - Added the `enforced_collaboration` option to prevent idle agents when the number of tasks decreases towards the end of an episode. When `enforced_collaboration` is set to True, agents will collaborate if only one local task remains visible.

- **First Claim Greedy (`greedy.py`)**
  - Renamed `LocalSearch` to `FirstClaimGreedy`.
  - Enhanced the task selection mechanism to exclude tasks already claimed by neighboring agents during the local task selection process (That's why it is renamed as `FirstClaimGreedy`) 
  - Added the `enforced_collaboration` option to prevent idle agents when the number of tasks decreases towards the end of an episode. When `enforced_collaboration` is set to True, agents will collaborate if only one local task remains visible.

- **Decision-Maker Logic**
  - For decision making plugins such as `grape.py`, the logic should be doing "checking if the existing task is done" very first. 

## Version 1.2.8 (24-07-28)
### New Features

- **Monte Carlo Runner (`mc_runner.py`)**
  - To run the Monte Carlo simulations, use the following command:
    ```bash
    python mc_runner.py --config=my_config.yaml --num_runs=10
    ```
  - This will execute the configuration specified in my_config.yaml 10 times.

- **Monte Carlo Analyzer (`mc_analyzer.py`)**
  - To analyze the Monte Carlo simulation results, use the command:
    ```bash
    python mc_analyzer.py --config=mc_comparison.yaml
    ```
  - `mc_comparison.yaml` file should contain the following settings:
    - `cases`: Specifies the directories and filenames (excluding the YYYY-MM-DD date part) where the CSV results are stored.
    - `labels`: Specifies the names to use as labels in the plots.



### Changes
- **Result Saver (`utils.py`)**
  - Refactored the result-saving functionality into a `ResultSaver` class, and updated the configuration YAML file format accordingly.
  - Added the `with_date_subfolder` option (Boolean) to allow saving results in a subfolder named after the current date (`YYYY-MM-DD`). This option is recommended to be set to `False` for Monte Carlo tests.
  - Introduced the `save_gif` option to enable recording a GIF of the simulation from the start.
  - Renamed `time_recording_mode` to `save_time_series_plot` for clarity.
  - Added the `save_yaml` option for saving the configuration file used in the simulation.
  - By default, time-series plot results are saved as a PNG file without displaying them in a new window.


## Version 1.2.7 (24-07-27)
### New Features
- **CBBA (`cbba.py`)**: Implemented the CBBA algorithm in "Consensus-Based Decentralized Auctions for Robust Task Allocation" (HL Choi, L Brunet, JP How, IEEE Transactions on Robotics, 2009). 
  - Added `execute_movements_during_convergence` parameter to `CBBA` settings. This allows agents to make movements based on local decisions even if they haven't yet converged to a consensus.
  
- **Rendering Option**: 
  - Added `agent_path_to_assigned_tasks` in the configuration to show the path generated by CBBA. 
- **GRAPE Algorithm Enhancements (`grape.py`)**:
  - Addded `cost_weight_factor` and `social_inhibition_factor` to accomodate MT-SR scenario

- **Monte Carlo Test**:
  - Added `output_folder` in the configuration, where the results of each scenario is saved. 

### Changes
- **Minor Revision**
  - `agent.py`: Removed redundant code structure in `local_broadcast()`
- **Behavior Tree Refinement**
  - Removed the use of `blackboard` for retrieving values outside of the Behavior Tree. The `blackboard` is now strictly used within the Behavior Tree nodes for internal communication and data storage.
- **Agent Structure Update**
  - Added `agent.assigned_task_id` to facilitate the visualization of assigned tasks for each agent, ensuring a clear representation of task assignments.
  - Renamed `agent.assigned_tasks` to  `agent.planned_path` to represent the path planned by the agent, such as the outcome from CBBA (Consensus-Based Bundle Algorithm) or other algorithms.



## Version 1.2.6 (24-07-25)
### Changes
- **Computation Optimisation**
  - `grape.py`: Minimized the use of `deepcopy()` in `distributed_mutex()`. Utilised an equivalent function to reduce computational overhead.
  - `agent.py`: 
    - Optimized `local_broadcast()` function.
    - Removed redundant `if` statement in `receive_message()` to enhance performance.
    - Improved `draw_communication_topology()` by preventing redundant line drawing.



## Version 1.2.5 (24-07-22)
### New Features
- **Behavior Tree Defined by Groot**
  - Using [Groot2](https://www.behaviortree.dev/groot/), the visualization tool for BT.CPP, you can now define and visualize the behavior tree of agents in the SPACE simulator. The behavior tree file (`.xml`) should be specified by the `behavior_tree_xml` entry in the configuration file.

### Changes
- **Behavior Tree Blackboard Variables**
  - Removed unnecessary variables from the `blackboard`, such as `next_waypoint` and `task_completed`. Consequently, the `DecisionMakingNode` (including decision-making plugins like `grape.py` and `simple.py`) now only sets the `assigned_task_id` as its output, enhancing the readability of decision-making plugins.
  - Renamed `next_waypoint` to `random_waypoint` in the `ExplorationNode` to avoid confusion, as the original name might be misleading.
  - Added `_reset_bt_action_node_status()` to reset the statuses of behavior tree action nodes for each agent before starting the tree.


## Version 1.2.4 (24-07-21)

### New Features
- **Dynamic Task Generation (`main.py`)**:
  - By setting `dynamic_task_generation.enabled: True` in the configuration file, additional tasks (`tasks_per_generation`) can be generated at specified intervals (`interval_seconds`) until the maximum number of generations (`max_generations`) is reached.
  - Various scripts (`agent.py`, `task.py`, `grape.py`) have been updated to be compatible with the integration of these newly-generated tasks during a mission.

- **Rendering Mode**: 
  - Introduced `agent_work_done` feature: Displays the total distance moved and the amount of work done by each agent.

- **Time Series Plot Mode**  
  - When `time_recording_mode` is set to `True`, the simulation will save the time series data of agents' activities to CSV files and generate corresponding PNG plots. This feature provides a comprehensive view of the simulation's progress over time, including metrics such as total distance moved by agents, total task amount done, the number of remaining tasks, and the total amount of tasks.


## Version 1.2.3 (24-07-19)

### New Features
- **GRAPE Algorithm Enhancements (`grape.py`)**:
  - **Decision-Making Process**: It is now based on agents' local situation awareness (`situation_awareness_radius`) and local communication capability (`communication_radius`), not by global information.
  - **Decision-Making Process**: Added logic at the beginning of the `decide()` function to stop and exit the decision-making process if no nearby tasks are found using `self.agent.get_tasks_nearby()`.
  - **Renamed**: `get_assigned_task_id_from_partition()` to `get_assigned_task_from_partition()`: Updated to return the `Task` object directly for efficiency. Note: `self.assigned_task` is the agent's local information about which task it has chosen. This information is not shared outside the behavior tree or used elsewhere.
  - **Renamed**: `get_neighbor_agents_info()` to `get_neighbor_agents_info_in_partition()`: Changed to avoid confusion with `get_agents_nearby()`. `get_neighbor_agents_info_in_partition()` is used to get a list of agents within the same coalition based on partition information.

- **Local Information for Agents (`agent.py`)**
  - Added `get_tasks_nearby()` to list tasks within the agent's `situation_awareness_radius` as defined in `config.yaml`.
  - Added `get_agents_nearby()` to list agents within the agent's `communication_radius` as defined in `config.yaml`.
- **Random Exploration Search (`behavior_tree.py`)**
  - Added `ExplorationNode`: If there is no task nearby, agent selects a random location within the task generation range and sets it as the `next_waypoint`, enabling the agent to exploare new tasks while moving to this point.

- **Local Search (`simple.py`)**
  - Renamed `LocalRandomSearch` to `LocalSearch`, which refers to the decision-making methodology for selecting a task within the agent's `situation_awareness_radius`.
  - Implemented three modes (`Random`, `MinDist`, `MaxUtil`) within `LocalSearch`.
    - **`Random` mode**: Selects a task randomly.
    - **`MinDist` mode**: Selects the task with the shortest distance.
    - **`MaxUtil` mode**: Selects the task with the highest individual utility. Utilizes `weight_factor_cost` (defined in `config.yaml`) to balance task reward and cost.
  - To this end, `get_tasks_nearby()` was required to be modified such that it can provide "alive(not `completed`)" local tasks. 


### Changes
- **Random SearchBehavior Tree (`behavior_tree.py`)**
  - **Updated**: Enhanced `DecisionMakingNode` to complete the decision-making process by setting the `assigned_task_id` and recording the corresponding `next_waypoint` in the blackboard. This change removes the need for the `ConsensusCheckingNode`.
  - **Removed**: `ConsensusCheckingNode`
- **Behavior Tree Structure (`agent.py`)**
  - Modified to use a Fallback node to sequence Decision Making and Task Execution. If these fail (i.e., decision-making is not successful), the agent performs random movement through the Exploration node.
- **LocalRandomSearch Algorithm (simple.py)**:
  - Streamlined core logic for clarity by moving additional functionalities (such as random walk) to `DecisionMakingNode`.  


## Version 1.2.2 (24-07-17)
### New Features
- **LocalRandomSearch Algorithm (simple.py)**:
  - Implemented a random search algorithm enabling agents to select tasks randomly within their `situation_awareness_radius`. If no tasks are within range, agents randomly move to a new position for up to `max_random_movement_duration` seconds.
- **Configuration File Handling**: Added command-line argument parsing to `main.py` to accept a custom configuration file path using the `--config` option. (e.g., `python main.py --config=./examples/GRAPE_20_agents_200_tasks.yaml` )
- **Rendering Mode**: 
  - Added `rendering_mode` configuration option to toggle rendering of graphical output.
  - Introduced `rendering_options` under `simulation` configuration section to customize rendering settings when `rendering_mode` is enabled:
    - `agent_tail`: Enables drawing of agent trajectory tails.
    - `agent_communication_topology`: Enables visualization of agent communication topology.
    - `agent_id`: Displays agent identifiers on the screen.
    - `agent_assigned_task_id`: Shows the task identifier assigned to each agent.
    - `task_id`: Displays task identifiers on the tasks.
    - `agent_situation_awareness_circle`: Displays agent situational awareness circle. 

### Changes
- **Configuration**:
  - Splitted `decision_making` from `agents`. 
- **Decision-Making Status Display**
  - Moved the decision-making status drawing function from `main.py` to the respective decision-making modules. This change allows developers to implement their own display functions.


## Version 1.2.1 (24-07-16)
### New Features
- **Profiling Mode**: Added profiling capability using `cProfile`. Set `simulation.profiling_mode = True` to enable performance analysis of each function.
- **GRAPE Algorithm Enhancements**:
  - Added `execute_movements_during_convergence` parameter to `GRAPE` settings. This allows agents to make movements based on local decisions even if they haven't yet converged to a Nash stable partition.
  - Introduced `initialize_partition` and `reinitialize_partition_on_completion` methods (defined in `config.yaml`) to enhance the efficiency of achieving Nash stable partitions.

### Changes
- **Agent Global Information (agent.py)**:
  - Enabled each agent to access global information about all agents (i.e., `agents_info`). Note that `tasks_info` is also global information about tasks. 
- **Agent Draw (agent.py)**:
  - Introduced default drawing of agent tails for improved visualization.

- **GRAPE (grape.py)**
  - Resolved issues in `distributed_mutex` related to message handling.
  - Unified decision-making using `self.assigned_task` throughout the algorithm for clarity, eliminating confusion associated with `_assigned_task_id`.

- **GIF and Config Copy (main.py)**:
  - Integrated shutil to copy config.yaml alongside generated GIFs for easy simulation configuration reference.


## Version 1.2.0 (24-07-15)

### New Features
- **GRAPE (grape.py)**: Implemented the GRAPE algorithm in "Anonymous Hedonic Game for Task Allocation in a Large-Scale Multiple Agent System" (I. Jang, H.S. Shin, A. Tsourdos, IEEE Transactions on Robotics, Dec. 2018).
- **Agent Communication (agent.py)**:
  - Introduced `local_broadcast` method for agent local communication, utilizing `communication_radius` defined in `config.yaml`.
  - Added `draw_communication_topology` for visualizing communication lines based on agent topology.
- **Assigned Task Visualization**: Agents' colors now represent the colors of their assigned tasks for improved visual distinction.


## Version 1.1.0 (24.07-14)

### New Features
- **Simulation Time Display**: The simulation now uses a simulation time based on sampling time, which is displayed in the top right corner of the screen. This provides a more accurate representation of the simulation's progress rather than real-time elapsed.
- **Task Amount Visualization**: Tasks now have an amount range that determines their radius visually on the screen, enhancing the clarity of task sizes.

### Changes
- **Main Game Loop (main.py)**:
  - Updated the task time display to use `simulation_time` instead of real-time.
  - Draw `tasks` first and then `agents`.

- **Task Class (task.py)**:
  - Added `amount` attribute to represent the task's amount.
  - Added `reduce_amount` method to decrease the task's amount over time and mark it as completed.
  - Updated the `draw` method to visualize tasks based on their `amount`.

- **Behavior Tree (behavior_tree.py)**: 
  - Added `work_rate` to `TaskExecutingNode` to allow agents to work on tasks and reduce their amounts.

- **Configuration (config.yaml)**:
  - Added `work_rate` for agents.
  - Added `amounts` configuration to define the range of task amounts.
  - Added `task_visualisation_factor` to adjust the visual representation of tasks based on their amounts.
